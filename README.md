## A. Overview

This is a basic World of Warcraft addon that I'm making so I can (a) learn 
how to write World of Warcraft addons, and (b) learn Lua. (:

## B. Running the Addon

To run the addon:

1. Navigate to your World of Warcraft folder.
2. From here, navigate to the Interface/Addons/ folder.
3. Place the HelloWorld folder from this repo in the Addons folder.
4. Open the game and make sure the addon is enabled!

## C. Credits

I'm making this addon with the help of 
[this guide from Wowhead](http://www.wowhead.com/guide=1949/wow-addon-writing-guide-part-one-how-to-make-your-first-addon).
